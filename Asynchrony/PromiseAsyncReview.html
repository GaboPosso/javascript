      The promis eobject represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an Asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

      <h2>Using Promises</h2>
      <p>
        Essentially, a promise is a returne object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function, imagine a function, <code>createAudioFileAsync()</code>,  which aynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions, one called if the audio files is succesfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.
